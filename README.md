# User Story

AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

This online application will allow you to read and post what you desire. Currently it is formated for a tech blog but 
that can be changed if you so desire to.

## Installation

N/A

On page load you will be greeted by the main screen. You can read others posts but you can not post yourself
unless you are signed up and logged in. Once you hit the login or signup button, you will be taken to the login page where you will be prompted
to use your email and password.

## Usage

This application will allow you to share and read other's posts about any topic. Currently it is set up as a tech blog but that can be changed to anything you choose. It can be found here: https://quiet-hollows-64358-f06962d762ce.herokuapp.com/
